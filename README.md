Summary: 

Question one – How many roles will need to be filled?

72,458 "silver tsunami" roles may need to filled to cover the impact. This is on the premise that all 72,458 retirees actual retire. If its staggered time frame over the course of several years the PH has breathing room to train new employees with the help of the mentorship program. 

Question two – are there enough qualified retirement-ready employees in departments to mentor next generation of PH employees?

The data indicates that yes, there should be enough retirement-ready employees to help mentor the next generation. What would be equally helpful is if retirement ready employees could train multiple employees

Two additional queries could be

1.	Expanding on mentorship total to include a larger group. Meaning expanding the birth date years . The larger influx will help provide a wider mentor range.

2.	Determining the each month how many retiree plan on retiring and we can specify by title as well for this particular query.
